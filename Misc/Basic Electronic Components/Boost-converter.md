Boost converter main component is an inductor. When there is a sudden change in current, the inductor will try to increase voltage to keep that current flow through circuit.

Blue is the switch signal. When the switch is ON, current from inductor ramps up. Most of the current goes to ground. Capcitor discharges that lead to the voltage drop shown above.
